## Stakeholders

The main shareholders and board directors are the family of Y, in which they own 60% of the project shares, while the 40% left are for investors in stock. Shareholders of Y consist of -mainly- of Mr. A, the CEO of the project. Our product owner (Mr. P) will be in direct communication with him to ensure that the ideas and strategies of the client (Mr. A) are well understood and met by the agile team. There are other minor stakeholders that will be also joining the discussion about this product with the product owner and their takes will be also taken into consideration.

## Stakeholders Goal

> Our goal in this project is to establish an e-commerce website that can have the potential to challenge the competitors such as Amazon and Jumia. We plan to start only in Cairo and Giza, but we have the plan and the vision to expand to The whole Arab republic of Egypt as well as the gulf countries. Our motto  is simple: Quality products, fast delivery, happy customer.

## Near Vision

The near vision of this product is to establish a live and working platform that can support the demand of users of Cairo and Giza, starting with a simple shipping tracking system. This vision includes only a website and not the applications.

**Our Near vision** is planned to be achieve within Release 1. Release 1 is composed of 2 Epics as shown:

![Release Plan](release1.png)
the aggregation of Epic 1 and Epic 2, will be our starting point.

After the release is completed, we plan to start expanding by (incrementally, thanks to Agile) until we achieve our Far vision.

## Far Vision

The far vision of this product is to evolve our system to support the entire republic of Egypt, supporting millions of users, expanding to the gulf countries, adding all possible categories of products and have a large share of the e-commerce in Egypt and the middle east by having a complex yet rapid order packaging and delivery system that reduces the time between order placement and order delivery. In addition, having a responsive and average-user-friendly application for ease of ordering.

## Estimating story points per sprint
As indicated and supported from part 1, our team on average executed 15 story point per sprint. Stories are ranging from 1 to 3 story points. It’s worth noting that the numbers (1, 3) are relative numbers to our team and not a universal scale. We have found that 1 story point, for our 7-members long-lived team, achieves an average-sized story, while a 3 story points for the longer and more complicated stories. At some point we may need a 5, or even a 7, story point per story depending on the story size but we haven’t met this case yet in out near vision of the project. But, for the current project, the sizes of the stories are relatively close and hence we are sticking to the numbers 1 and 3. More clarification on why exactly we are choosing 1, 3, 5, 7 sequence shortly.
